# SemanticHTML-Challenge

## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT the website has the correct format and is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logigal structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN i view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I achieved this by 
-removing non semantic elements 
-changing the non semantic elements to semantic elemets in both HTML and CSS 
- deleting the duplicates in CSS and then merged them into one in order to have the page meet the criteria given.
- put heading elements in sequential order
